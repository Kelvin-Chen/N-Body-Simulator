# N Body Gravity Simulator

This simulator uses the [Barnes-Hut algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation) to simulate gravity
on n bodies with logarithmic complexity!

## Demo

## Controls

* `Mouse click` - insert particle at mouse click location
* `Spacebar` - pause/unpause simulator (default paused)
* `[` and `]` - slow down and speed up the simulator
* `t` - view the Barnes-Hut quad tree
* `r` - reset simulator
* You can also generate some interesting default patterns with the particles:
  * `s` - square
  * `S` - spiral
  * `c` - circle
  * `e` - ellipse
